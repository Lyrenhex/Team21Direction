a)
We decided to use a risk register in order to show our risks in a clear and concise way. The risk register serves as a central repository for the project's risk information and allows for the information that results from the risk management process to be suitably sorted, standardized, and merged for relevance to the appropriate level of management. Its key function is to provide the team with significant information on the main risks faced by the project. The risk register also gives the teams risk management stakeholders a clear view of the current status of each risk, at any point in time. A risk register as part of the risk management plan and will help the team to:

- Understand the nature of the risks the team faces.
- Become aware of the extent of those risks.
- Identify the level of risk that the team is willing to accept.
- Recognise its ability to control and reduce risk.
- Report the risk status at any point in time.
- Have in place risk event "early warning" factors and upward reporting thresholds.

The risk register will help the team record the following risk management information:

- The type of risk.
- Description of the risk
- Likelihood of the risk occurring and its potential impact to the project.
- Risk mitigation/reduction actions taken in case the risk does occur.
- Who’s responsible for the risk

How did we manage the risks?

- We created a very detailed risk register in order to see the risks that we may encounter. This way risks can be identified in every stage of the project. We got the entire team involved in order to identify and prioritise all the potential risks that we feel we may encounter and assigned them to different team members. We then updated the risk register whenever any changes we felt should be made in order to keep it up to date with our project.

How did we identify risk?

- One way we did this is that we brainstormed with the team to gather the information we needed to both identify and resolve the risks. We thought of as many risks as we thought relevant and noted them down to put in our register. We made sure that the risks we had were rooted in the cause of the problem. So drilling down to the root cause to see if the risk is one that will have the kind of impact on your project that needs identifying. When trying to minimise risk it was useful for us to trust our intuition as this helped point us to unlikely scenarios that we assumed just couldn’t happen.

How did we analyse risk?

- Analyzing the risk can be difficult as you can only have so much information. So in order to analyse the risk we used the information that we had and brainstormed the best we could with that information in order to find as many risks as we found suitable.

How did we track risk?

- In order to track the risk we saw that whoever owned the risk would be responsible for tracking if it occurs and and it’s progress of resolution should it occur. They also would make others aware of this in order to keep everyone up to date. We did this by setting up a series of meetings in order to manage the risk and made sure that we were transparent with each other in order to give everyone the full clarity of all issues that were occuring
