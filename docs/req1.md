## Elicitation

- We began eliciting requirements by reading through the game brief we were given at the beginning of the project looking for any ambiguity, either a feature with generally limited explanation or a feature thatâ€™s implementation could change to work best depending on the context surrounding the game. 
- Having gone through all of the explicit requirements, highlighting any key areas that needed further discussion, we formulated questions which we felt would shed light on each of our qualms with the brief. 
- We took these questions to the customer so that we could get a clear understanding of what they required rather than simply speculating within the development team. 
- Our customer meeting allowed us to find out exactly what the customer wanted for each feature and to understand the context surrounding the game. 
- The game is designed to be played at a university open day event, this means that people should be able to walk up and complete the entire experience in five to ten minutes. This context played an important role in deciding how the game should be structured and is intrinsically linked to many of the requirements.
- When formalising requirements we began by coming up with the user requirements, these are written for non-technical people involved in the requirements process and relate directly to the actions that the user will take. 
- The User requirements table defines a requirements idea, describes the requirement and makes a note of any environmental assumptions we have made when coming up with the requirement. 
- There are two more tables which hold our system requirements, each system requirement is given a requirement id, described and where appropriate linked to one of the user requirement ids so that it is clear how the requirement will help in completing the project. 
- The system requirements are split into functional and non-functional requirements
- Functional requirements are the things the game must do
- Non-Functional requirements detail the qualities the game must have
- Each non-functional requirement will have fit criteria which are precise criteria on which the success of the system can be judged

## Statement of Requirements

### Single Statement of Needs

The game should be playable by visitors on a university open day do that they have an enjoyable experience and may be inspired to pursue Computer Science.

### User Requirements

| ID | Description | Priority | Environmental Assumptions |
|---|---|---|---|
|UR_LAUNCH|The user should be able to launch the game without the need to open any additional software on the device|Should|While this is important in the context of the open day the game will already be open ready for the user to play|
|UR_EASY_TO_UNDERSTAND|The user should be able to quickly understand the controls and narrative of the game.|Shall|The user will be seeing the game for the first time when they come to play it but will be comfortable using a keyboard and mouse to control a computer |

|UR_RUN_TIME|The game should take between 5 to 6 minutes to complete for a new player. This will involve capturing or destroying 4 colleges.|Should|Visitors will want to spend time looking around the university and town and therefore will not want to spend too long on the game|
|UR_CONTROLS|The player should be able to control the game using only the keyboard|Shall||

|UR_MUTE_SOUND|The player should be able to mute the game sound at any time during gameplay|May|The game will be played in a public setting, likely with conversations taking place so it is important that the sound can be muted easily|
|UR_UPGRADES|The player should be able to upgrade their ship as the game progresses with new weapons or abilities|Should||
|UR_FAIRNESS|The game should be fair on the player, offering a satisfying level of challenge whilst not leading to frustration. There should be a new player win rate of around 90%|Should|Players will likely only get one opportunity to play so the game needs to be easy enough that they will likely win first try|
|UR_INSPIRATIONAL|The game should have an inspirational effect on the player, compelling them to pursue computing themselves|Shall||
|UR_FUN|The player should leave the game with a positive mindset|Shall|The open|
|UR_WIN|The player should be able to achieve a predefined condition within the game which triggers a win|Shall||
|UR_SOUND|The player will be able to hear music and sound effects which relate to the actions taking place on screen.|Should|The game will be played in an open day environment, likely with lots of background noise and people talking, as a result of this it may be preferable to play without game sound|
|UR_GOLD|The player ship should be able to earn gold throughout the course of the game|Shall||
